# Firebase Data Export to Excel

This Python script connects to Firebase and exports data from specified Firestore collections to an Excel file. The data is organized into separate tabs in the Excel file, one tab per collection.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

1. Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).
2. The required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
3. A Firebase project with Firestore enabled.
4. A Firebase service account key (JSON file) with appropriate permissions to access the Firestore collections.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Place your Firebase service account key JSON file in the project directory and update the script with the correct path to this file.
3. Create a `collections.json` file in the project directory to specify the collections and fields you want to export. The format should be as follows:

```json
{
  "collection_name1": ["field_name1", "field_name2"],
  "collection_name2": ["field_name3", "field_name4"]
}
```
